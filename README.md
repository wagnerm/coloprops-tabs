# coloprops-tabs

A Chrome extension for coloproperty.com to convert the address links on the map to actual links that can be opened in tabs.

With this loaded, you can right click + open in new tab on the link. The site still has some js to open the property in the current window if you cmd+middle mouse button, so that doesn't work yet.

## Installation

Load the extension manually by
1. Go to `chrome://extensions`
1. Clone this repo
2. `Load unpackaged` from local file system.
